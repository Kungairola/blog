## learning how to code

### Bullet points `I am a code`
learning how to code without money is very difficult and dangerous 
first sort out your room then start to learn coding

open source is the chad for people who dont want to pay for learning more 

its a cool community of people on git-hub who have loads of programmed stuff and there code in the form of
repository

we can basically clone it on our own virtual studio code and can start programming by either contributing
to it or learn from it

then we have languages like python, javascript, java and many more for web development or app development

 but to begin to understand those we will have to first understand syntax, then print hello wolrd 
 then maybe make prime number programmed
 there is a structure to programming like defining class, method and using functions 

 i have understood how to use them but i still struggle to understand how the memory works
 while programming for that i guess i will have to understand data types and algorithms 

 then the other thing that will come as pain is terminal 
 this lil shit is a spaced window beneath your programming window where you get the print of your variable
 but later on will demand commands to operate
  
  ##Who am i
   
   simpelton soul who wants to earn money through coding and live a peaceful life away from assholes 
   girls and 
   shitheads in general

whatever i have learned until now post my struggle with making my blog
okay so first important thing i leared was how to define a variable, make a method and function and how to 
use global() so that i can assign a function in the code and then call it
2. the next thing i have learned is runtime environment and about interpretor 
3. run time environment or interpretor is something that sort of understands the code and then executes it
4. for example node.js is for java script and PyPy is for Pyhton 
5. then what i learned was the basic syntax how it is different for different languages, for assigning it 
is different for execution it is different for different languages like- HTML, Python and Java script
6 . next thing i have learned was about Open source, what is open source , basically something or anything
whose source code is available for free, it can be modified, it can be distributed, you can work with a 
team together, learn from the exisiting code or make some contributions
7. for example lets say we have git- hub there we can make our own repositories and also create our own
history and commit in our projects 
8. another important thing that i have learned is that how to use command prompt and terminal in virtual 
studio code
9. and the new and most important thing that i have learned is how to first execute programme locally
which i learned is also called developer phase and when we operate it in remote environment it 
is called run time space and we should not mess with that before hand
