## learning how to code

- Bullet points
`I am a code`
learning how to code without money is very difficult and dangerous 
first sort out your room then start to learn coding

open source is the chad for people who dont want to pay for learning more 

its a cool community of people on git-hub who have loads of programmed stuff and there code in the form of
repository

we can basically clone it on our own virtual studio code and can start programming by either contributing
to it or learn from it

then we have languages like python, javascript, java and many more for web development or app development

 but to begin to understand those we will have to first understand syntax, then print hello wolrd 
 then maybe make prime number programmed
 there is a structure to programming like defining class, method and using functions 

 i have understood how to use them but i still struggle to understand how the memory works
 while programming for that i guess i will have to understand data types and algorithms 

 then the other thing that will come as pain is terminal 
 this lil shit is a spaced window beneath your programming window where you get the print of your variable
 but later on will demand commands to operate

   simpelton soul who wants to earn money through coding and live a peaceful life away from assholes

   shitheads in general
